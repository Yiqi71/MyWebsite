                A website designed to visualize complex quantum concepts, 
                making them accessible and interactive for a broader audience.
                I was responsible for <strong>front-end development</strong>, 
                coding and building the entire website using modern web technologies. 
                My work included designing the user interface, 
                ensuring responsive layouts, 
                and integrating interactive features to enhance user engagement.
