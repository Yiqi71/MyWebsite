                A website designed to visualize complex quantum concepts, making them accessible and interactive for a broader audience.
                I was responsible for <strong>front-end development</strong>, coding and building the entire website using modern web technologies. 
                My work included designing the user interface, ensuring responsive layouts, and integrating interactive features to enhance user engagement.
