### Book responding to: Why Look at Animals

Animals are often pushed to the margins and silenced in human narratives.
</p> 
<p> “What we know about them is an index of our power, and thus an index of what separate us from them. The more we know, the further away they are.” (p16)
</p> 
<p>
This quote reflects a troubling perspective: when humans "study" animals, they are often positioned as subjects below us — observed, classified, and controlled. But animals, like humans, are co-inhabitants of the Earth. So are plants.

Urban trees are in a similar situation. They are frequently reduced to their utility — seen as decorative elements or natural air purifiers. Rarely are they recognized as living beings with presence, resilience, or story.

**TreeFriend** challenges this viewpoint. It invites people to see trees not as background objects, but as neighbors — each with a unique personality, a memory, and a voice worth listening to.

            This website is designed to give users advice on which picture is "better." <br>
            Inspired by the reading <i>The Defecating Duck</i>, I originally started this project as a machine learning experiment. 
            My goal was for Kiwi—the system I created—to replicate my personal bias when judging images. 
            I went through the full process: assembling a dataset of images with corresponding scores, feeding them into a program, and training a model.  <br><br>
            Although the model technically worked, the results were far from accurate. 
            That failure led me to a new direction: what if the outcomes were completely random, yet presented with confidence—as if they were the result of complex computation?  <br><br>
            This idea evolved into Kiwi, a mysterious character who dispenses picture-judging wisdom. The randomness is intentional, but users may still try to find meaning in Kiwi’s decisions.  <br><br>
            The project draws direct inspiration from the story in <i>The Defecating Duck</i>, where someone claimed to have built a machine that could play chess, but in reality, a human hidden underneath controlled the moves. Like that illusion, Kiwi gives off an air of intelligence, while the real mechanism is either flawed machine learning—or pure chance.
