        <p>This is a chrome extension collecting usersâ€™ browsing activity, visualizing the data collected, and reminding users of the potential risk of data collection and privacy leak.</p>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Many companies and apps are collecting data from users.</li>
            <li>I cannot stop them, but I want to know what kinds of my data are collected.</li>
            <li>I want to remind people of the potential risk behind data collection, because data collection is difficult to see.</li>
            <li>Why extension? - Chrome and many other browsers are definitely big companies collecting data from users. Extension can appear on any pages inside the browser and work as a reminder, so I think extension is a good medium for this project.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="process">
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fetching Chrome history API</li>
            <li>Arranging the collected data into meaningful arrays</li>
            <li>Data visualization</li>
            <li>Add more interaction (the appearing blocks when users are on any tabs)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I am still working on publishing my extension. It was rejected once because of the permissions I was asking for. The second submission is still pending review.</p>
