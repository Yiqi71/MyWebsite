My goal was for Kiwi—the system I created—to replicate my personal bias when judging images. I went through the full process: assembling a dataset of images with corresponding scores, feeding them into a program, and training a model.<br><br>Although the model technically worked, the results were far from accurate. That failure led me to a new direction: what if the outcomes were completely random, yet presented with confidence—as if they were the result of complex computation?<br><br>This idea evolved into Kiwi, a mysterious character who dispenses picture-judging wisdom. The randomness is intentional, but users may still try to find meaning in Kiwi’s decisions.<br><br>The project draws direct inspiration from the story in <i>The Defecating Duck</i>, where someone claimed to have built a machine that could play chess, but in reality, a human hidden underneath controlled the moves. Like that illusion, Kiwi gives off an air of intelligence, while the real mechanism is either flawed machine learning—or pure chance."
